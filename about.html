      <h5>Founder/Principal Engineer</h5>
      <img src="tony175.jpg">
      <p>
        Tony has been hacking out code since he was in third grade writing BASIC and Logo on his dadâ€™s Commodore 64. He graduated from the College of William and Mary with a BS in Computer Science in 2000. Afterwards, he began his career in software development and consulting. He also taught computer science to high school students and served a tour as a paratrooper in the armed forces where he earned the Purple Heart and Army Commendation medals.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an engineer and consultant, Tony has led numerous software projects and has provided direction and consultation for the adoption of agile development methodologies, continuous integrations, TDD, BDD, DevOps automation, RESTful web services, and the Atlassian development tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        In business, Tony's goal is to forge cooperative relationships and customer engagements where every party gains more value than they give up.

    <h4>Nick</h4>
      <h5>Co-Founder/Principal Engineer</h5>
      <img src="nick175.jpg">
      <p>
        Nick is a talented and passionate programmer with over thirteen years of hands-on experience. He assembled his first computer from broken computer parts while in middle school, and started working as a full-time programmer as a teenager.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduation with a degree in Computer Science from Old Dominion University in 2004, Nick spent the next seven years building intelligent control systems for coal burning power plants in the U.S. and internationally. Afterwards, he helped Virginia's Liberty University implement modern and sophisticated programming practices. Nick's experience with technical expertise allow him to communicate clearly with each customer, create testable code, and use verifiable analytics. Each of these three components drives customer value and continues to deliver successful projects.

    <h4>Jon</h4>
      <h5>Principal Engineer</h5>
      <img src="jon175.jpg">
      <p>
        Jon is a developer with over 10 years of experience. He began developing websites in the early 2000's, in the days when animated GIF's and marquees were all the rage; and found a passion for crafting quality websites and applications that has continued ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jon has worked professionally for enterprise institutions and startups, through which he has gained experience in all aspects of development. His specialization is frontend development, where he prides himself on not just completing a project, but making sure the user is able to effectively and enjoyably use it.

    <h4>Ryan</h4>
      <h5>Software Developer</h5>
      <img src="ryan175.jpg">
      <p>
        Ryan grew up in South Africa and has been programming for about as long as he has had a computer. He got his start by teaching himself how to code from textbooks and help files. After taking classes in High School, he decided to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Liberty University, which he received in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
        His specialization is being able to learn new things quickly. This skill has enabled him to build or work on projects spanning a number of platforms and programming languages. It has also helped him successfully investigate undocumented systems, security breaches, and complex bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to being passionate about learning new things, he is also passionate about passing on what he is learning to anyone who wants to learn. He enjoys working with our apprentices and giving guest lectures for his former professors.
      </p>
      <p>
        He loves to make code clear and easy to maintain by using object-oriented design and functional programming techniques. He also has an interest in information security that probably comes from growing up in a country with a very high crime rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he isn't developing software, he enjoys ginger beer, running, shooting handguns, urban exploration, driving down curvy country roads, and (as a testament to his ability to learn new things) knitting.
